# EDI Guide Catalog
Stedi public roadmap of EDI specifications to be added to EDI Guide Catalog: https://www.stedi.com/edi/catalog

Unlike traditional PDF or CSV implementation guides, Stedi guides capture EDI requirements in a machine-readable format that you can share as an interactive web page. The EDI Inspector lets you instantly validate test files against the guide's specifications in your web browser.

You can create private guides for free and use them with [Stedi Core](https://www.stedi.com/docs/core) to validate, translate, and generate EDI documents. You can also [make your guides public](https://www.stedi.com/docs/guides/public-guides) to share them with trading partners.

### Need a different guide? 
Use [this form](https://github.com/Stedi-Demos/edi-guide-catalog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=request-a-guide.yml&title=%5BGUIDE%5D+Company+name) to request new guides for any new trading partner, and weâ€™ll add them to the catalog for free. If you provide us with the PDFs, we typically can add them to the catalog within 48 hours.
